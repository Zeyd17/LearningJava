An android app primarlily focused to perform learning content for java Language concepts.This app is developed using kotlin and for storing the content we have used sqlite.The app provides all the basic knowledge about all the concepts of the java programming language with a well-defined User experience
## Usage
You can download the project using the command-line or you can directly download it from the github

After downloading the project you have to open the project through the android-Studio,make sure you are using the latest version of the android-studio along with all the necessary dependencies installed and it is important to have an emulator installed(you can use a physical device too).After performing all the necessary operations select your emulator device and press the run button above and it will create an instance of the emulator running the app
## Future Work
The app depends upon the book.db present in app/src/main/assets/Book.db ,you can convert this java learning into any other app by just replacing the Book.db with your desired language db and the data about the desired language will be displayed inside the app
